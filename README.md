# 7G-Replay-Editor

This software is an editor for replays files from Pokémon SM and Pokémon USUM.
You can download the binary from my website (https://lyviaff.kojuri.com/7g-replay-Editor), or compile the source code from this GitHub repository.
To edit a replay, drag and drop or browse your files with Windows Explorer to open the replay.
Once opened, the replay settings are displayed. Then select the settings you want to change and modify them, then validate. Note that this software make you able to convert replays from SM into replays from USUM and vice versa.

# This program is still in beta
You may encounter some problems or bugs.
When you import your replay, the software sometimes displays "Unknown" for an option, and some existing options are not known.
In these cases, please contact me at https://lyviaff.kojuri.com/contact, via Twitter or post a GitHub issue to let me know and make me able to update the software.
