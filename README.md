# 7G-Replay-Editor

This software is an editor for replays files from Pokémon SM and Pokémon USUM.
You can download the binary from my website (https://lyviaff.kojuri.com/7g-replay-editor), or compile the source code from this GitHub repository.
To edit a replay, drag and drop or browse your files with Windows Explorer to open the replay.
Once opened, the replay settings are displayed. Then select the settings you want to change and modify them, then validate. Note that this software make you able to convert replays from SM into replays from USUM and vice versa.
